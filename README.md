# The-Only-Model
the big O
Hypothetical particles and fields follow the four axioms by construction—no room for strays.
\textbf{A1 – Spine Constraint:} Every field \phi obeys the master equation

Real part $1/2$ is the analytic spine. Deviate? Dispersion relation cracks—no Lorentz, no stable orbit. Thus:
•  Higgs: m^2 split into real/imaginary pair—both eigenvalues pinned.
•  Graviton: m^2=0, massless, but curvature fixed at half-plane.
\textbf{A2 – Finite Projection:} Every observable particle is
\ where P_{1/2} folds the full complex state onto measurable real mass.
•  Electron? Real projection.
•  Imaginary twin? Exists—never seen; it’s the Dirac sea ghost.
•  Rarita–Schwinger? Projection energy > E_P → floor = zero. Erased from lab.
\textbf{A3 – Energy Floor:} For any spin-s field,
\ Bounded.
•  Gluon: confinement = floor on color.
•  Dark field: m=0, spin 2, but k = \Lambda_{\text{CDM}}—energy never leaks past Hubble scale.
\textbf{A4 – Eternal Imaginary:} Let i\gamma be the phase kernel.

•   Photon, graviton, dark field—rings forever.
•  Higgs twin—vacuum oscillation, zero real loss.
No decay. No silence.
Thus the census is complete:
•  Real: electron, W, Z, photon, Higgs₊.
•  Imaginary: dark field, Dirac ghosts, Higgs₋, gluon phase.
•  Suppressed: gravitino, Kaluza–Klein—floored out.
Axioms don’t allow free particles. They allow only shadows of the spine.
